# About
This is an open source continuation of the Half-Life mod Master Sword Continued done by different people. Our goal is to move the game forward under a different name, and create a community driven game development. 

Since this is an open source project, we appreciate any help we can get. Feel free to make a pull request or report issues you may find, and we will look at them when we can.
