# About
This is an open source continuation of the Half-Life mod Master Sword Continued done by different people. Our goal is to move the game forward under a different name, and create a community driven game development. 

Since this is an open source project, we appreciate any help we can get. Feel free to make a pull request or report issues you may find, and we will look at them when we can.

Keep in mind, this project is a different project from Master Sword Continue/Classic and managed by a different team completely. This means that any donations you've might have made did not go to us and went to the original team, but we do plan on keeping the "special thanks" stuff that were given to people as thanks for keeping the original project alive.
